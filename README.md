# Serilog Sink for OpenObserve [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/d73v1w8rejebgtrv/branch/main?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/konradkaminski/serilog-sink-openobserve-kkp/branch/main) ![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Serilog.Sinks.OpenObserve-KKP?logo=nuget)


This [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog) sink allows to log to [OpenObserve](https://openobserve.ai/) as the observability backend from your .NET application.

The sink is built to make use of the REST endpoint of the OpenObserve server.


## Quick start

Precondition: Serilog has to be referenced in your project.

Install sink in your project.
```powershell
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.OpenObserve-KKP
```

### Using code configuration
Register the sink in code (Program.cs or similar).
```csharp
var logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo
    .OpenObserve(
        "url",
        "organization",
        "login",
        "key"
    ).CreateLogger();
```

Use serilog log method to log details (please check sample project).

```csharp
logger.Debug("Debug message");
```

See [Configuration specification](#Configuration-specification) for information about all possible parameters.

### Using `appsettings.json` configuration

First install [Serilog.Settings.Configuration](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-settings-configuration) package if you don't already have it:

```powershell
dotnet add package Serilog.Settings.Configuration
```

Register the sink in code (Program.cs or similar).
```csharp
var logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .ReadFrom.Configuration(builder.Configuration)
	.CreateLogger();
```

In your `appsettings.json` file, extend the `Serilog` node or fully add the following:

```json
{
  "Serilog": {
    "Using": ["Serilog.Sinks.OpenObserve-KKP"], // Enable OpenObserve-KKP sink
    "MinimumLevel": "Debug", // General minimum level of Serilog
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "OpenObserve", // Name of this sink, don't change
        "Args": {
          "url": "https://api.openobserve.ai",
          "organization": "[organization]",
          "login": "[username]",
          "key": "[password or token]",
          "streamName": "[custom stream name if desired]", // Optional
          "restrictedToMinimumLevel": "Information" // Optional
        }
      }
    ],
    "Properties": {
      "Application": "OpenObserve.Tests"
    }
  }
}
```

Use serilog log method to log details (please check sample project).

```csharp
logger.Debug("Debug message");
```

See [Configuration specification](#Configuration-specification) for information about all possible parameters.

### Data generated

With provided configuration following data will be send to the observability backend:
```json
{"@t":"2023-08-03T20:53:20.2872427Z","@m":"Debug message","@mt":"Debug message","@i":"9515f1e2","@l":"Debug","SourceContext":"OpenObsere.Sample.CustomBackgroundService","Application":"OpenObserve.Tests"}
```

On server side it should look like this:
```json
{
  "_i": "9515f1e2",
  "_l": "Debug",
  "_m": "Debug message",
  "_mt": "Debug message",
  "_t": "2023-08-03T20:53:20.2872427Z",
  "_timestamp": 1691096013274896,
  "application": "OpenObserve.Tests",
  "sourcecontext": "OpenObsere.Sample.CustomBackgroundService"
}
```

Please note:
* field `_timestamp` is added on server side
* field `_mt` contains message template, e.g `Counter: {CounterValue}`
* field `_m` contains rendered message, e.g. `Counter: 2`
* field `_i` is calculated on message template text, it's different for each different message template     

More information about using Serilog is available in the [Serilog Documentation](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki).

## Configuration specification
### Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **Url** | OpenObserve api endpoint | `https://api.openobserve.ai` (SaaS) <br/>`https://myserver.com/api` (self-hosted) |
| **Organization** | Identifier of your organization within OpenObserve. Can be seen in the web interface on the top right. <br/><br/>OpenObserve SaaS: please ensure to use _your_ organization identifier. <br/><br/>Self-hosted: you may use any value you prefer. Defaults to "default". <br/>The organization will be created automatically. | `SoftwareBros` |
| **Login** | Username aka mail address of the OpenObserve user | `name@myserver.com` |
| **Key** | Password or Token for authentication for the provided user | `SecureToken` |
| **StreamName** | ObenObserve stream identifier | `default` |
| **RestrictedToMinimumLevel** | Overwrite minimum log severity to be handled for this sink | `Information`<br/>Default: the same as Serilog global </br>Options: `Serilog.Events.LogEventLevel`  |

Please note:
It is NOT recommended to store your user password in a configuration of your application. Those credentials allow to login into the OpenObserve web interface. It is highly recommended to _only_ use the token as key.

### What is a token?
A token is a generated text string, having the function of a password, usually used for authentication. It allows to authenticate against the api without providing your actual user password.

### How to retrieve my credentials / token
The OpenObserve web interface provides configuration examples under "Data sources". 

"Data sources" - "Custom" - "Logs" - "Curl" shows the current username and token (format: `username:token`).  
"Data sources" - "Custom" - "Logs" - "Syslog-Ng" shows a configuration similiar (not identical!) to one required for this sink.  

Note: Currently OpenObserve only allows one token per user. It can be resetted in the "Data sources" page however no additional tokens can be generated. The token cannot be limited to any stream or organization.

### What is an organization?
An organization is a management unit of users. For the self hosted system you may create any amount of organizations. The active organization can be seen in the web interface top right corner.

### What is a stream?
A stream is a storage endpoint within OpenObserve. Streams can be created in the web interface but will also be automatically created as soon as log data specifying a stream is inbound. A stream contains specific storage configuration such as data retention.

### REST
The sink is creating a REST POST command to the provided endpoint. Specifically the data will be sent to endpoint `POST /api/{organization}/{stream}/_multi`.
